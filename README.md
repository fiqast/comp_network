Network Design for Three-Story Campus Building
Overview
This project focuses on designing a reliable and efficient computer network for a three-story campus building located at Syahdan, Bina Nusantara University. The network is designed and implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer, with the primary goal of ensuring stable and seamless communication between devices across multiple floors.

Objectives
Network Architecture: The network is structured to facilitate smooth communication and resource sharing among devices on each floor. The design ensures that the network can handle various academic and administrative tasks while maintaining stability and performance.
IP Configuration: Static IP addressing is used across the network to provide consistent and efficient connectivity. Careful planning of IP addresses optimizes network performance and improves manageability.
Scalability and Efficiency: The project emphasizes scalability to accommodate future growth and changes in the network setup. The design includes subnetting and IP address allocation strategies to ensure efficient use of available resources.
Key Features
Static IP Configuration: Ensures each device has a fixed IP address, facilitating better network management and troubleshooting.
Multi-Floor Network Layout: The network supports three floors, each equipped with devices that communicate seamlessly across the building.
Optimized Resource Sharing: Designed to ensure high availability and efficient use of shared resources such as printers and file servers.
Cisco Packet Tracer Simulation: A detailed simulation of the network layout is created using Cisco Packet Tracer, showcasing practical implementation of theoretical network design concepts.
Skills Demonstrated
Network Design and Planning: Implementing a multi-floor network with careful planning to ensure scalability, performance, and reliability.
IP Address Management: Planning and configuring static IP addresses to optimize resource allocation and network performance.
Network Troubleshooting: Demonstrating the ability to address connectivity issues and optimize network configurations.
Conclusion
This project highlights my skills in network design, configuration, and troubleshooting, particularly in an academic setting. By using Cisco Packet Tracer, I have created a practical and reliable network that ensures efficient and stable communication across multiple floors of the campus building. This project showcases my ability to apply networking concepts to real-world scenarios and solve challenges related to network management.
